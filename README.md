## How to Play
- On loading of the game the player presses any arrow key to display the Enter Username Field.
- When the username is entered the user is brought to a screen to choose the game difficulty level: Easy, Medium or Hard
- The Game starts and the user has to use the arrow keys to move the Snake to collect food items dotted around the play area
- The user must avoid the side walls in the play area and not cross over on the Snakes own body
- As food is collected the Player score increases, the Snake's body grows longer and the Snake's speed increases adding to the game difficulty
- This process continues until the Snake is too large to continue or the player hits the wall or the Snake crosses over itself
- The Players score will be logged to the username and if the current Difficulty High Score is surpassed, the new score will display as the current High Score
- The Player will be given the option to start the Game again with the option of choosing a game difficulty level.
